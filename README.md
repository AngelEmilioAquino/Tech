# Tech Skill Test

This React project is designed to assess a developerâ€™s debugging, problem-solving, and attention-to-detail skills.  
The goal is to identify and fix the listed issues within **1 hour**.

## Bugs / Issues List

1. **Wrong calculation logic**  
   The completed tasks counter currently shows the total number of tasks instead of only completed ones.
 
2. **Missing search functionality**  
   The header search input exists but does not filter tasks as expected.

3. **Missing key props**  
   List items lack unique keys, causing React console warnings.

4. **Clear filters broken**  
   The reset button exists but has no implemented functionality.

5. **Division by zero**  
   Completion percentage calculation can result in `NaN` if there are no tasks.
